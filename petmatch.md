# Isaac Kim's Pet Owner Profile

**What kind of pet owner am I?**

Isaac is a kind-hearted person who loves to mingle with all types of pets. He's had a dog and a rabbit as a pet in his childhood years. He took care of them by walking the dog every other day and cleaning rabbit's cage every week. He really enjoyed the time he had with pets, especially when he prepared snacks for his adorable pets with impatient eyes just begging for the snacks. He now lives alone, so it is perfect time for him to have a pet which can mitigate his loneiness/homesickness. He will provide every effort and love he has to his dear pet.
